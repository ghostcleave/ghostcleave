Hello, I would just like to talk about this.

The support, love, and friends I've made because of you have kept me going.
Seriously, I wouldn't even be writing this if it weren't for you.
I hope you're okay with this message not going super deep. 
Writing personal stuff feels like showing everything, you know?

I wish for safe travels and constant guidance and protection for all readers.

May your life to come be filled with the graceful and lovely sand.

Goodnight - 3/22/2024
